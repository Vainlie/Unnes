00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.440
today I'll use body filler Bondo mud or

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.240
whatever you want to call it to repair

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.040
the dent in this quarter panel I'll

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.840
share with you how to mix apply shape

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.360
and block your filler and give you all

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.519
the tips tricks and techniques I use to

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.220
get a perfect OEM shape in your repair

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.680
or restoration project remember it's not

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.180
a dirty word it's just Bondo I'll walk

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.160
you through quickly how we got this Dent

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.199
prepared and ready for filler now this

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.539
Dent is about 18 inches we've got a

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.820
crease right down the center and we also

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.160
have a body line that's been damaged so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.200
we need to get that dent out we need to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.300
knock down the high areas around the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.579
dent so we'll tap down the crowns as we

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.200
pull out the center of that dent once I

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.059
have the majority of the dent pulled out

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.160
with the glue tabs we'll go ahead and

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.040
grind it down to Bare Metal now we're

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.020
going to use the g90e to pull out the

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.360
remaining dents now it's important not

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.980
to over pull at this point you want to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.739
leave a little bit of room so you can

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.079
use that filler properly to block that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.879
panel straight the dent has been removed

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.860
and we're now ready for some fillers so

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.600
we need to prepare the surface we're

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.900
going to apply the filler to with some

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.240
80 grit sandpaper we want a good 80 grit

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.799
scratch in those painted surfaces and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.200
over the metal so we have proper

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.119
adhesion now I like to apply it over the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.560
edge of the paint surface so we're going

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.140
to feather out this edge with the 80

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.420
grit sandpaper and then apply our filler

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.460
over it always check your technical data

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.920
sheet to find out if the filler you're

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.720
using can be applied Over Paint before

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.820
we apply our filler we want to clean the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.220
surface so I'm using some Sprayway glass

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.619
cleaner just to remove that dust residue

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.720
you can also use isopropyl alcohol or

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.460
wax and grease remover today we're using

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.200
U-Pull lightweight gold it's a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.439
reasonably priced filler that cuts

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.840
really well we mix our filler 50 to 1 or

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.060
2 percent hardener now you always want

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.860
to knead your hardener tube and mix that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.960
up before you apply it to your filler

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.180
U-Pull claims that their filler won't

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.100
separate when sitting in the can so I

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.960
was curious to see if that was true sure

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.000
enough I had no separation in the can

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.979
when I opened it up now I'm going to go

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.079
ahead and Stir It Up anyway and I'll

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.579
apply a little bit to my palette I'm not

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.500
going to need a ton of filler we're

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.539
going to do a thin coat fill those low

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.060
areas and then we'll go over it with a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.800
second coat always mix up your hardener

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.900
knead it in make sure it's all mixed up

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.640
in there before you apply it if a clear

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.739
liquid comes out you know that's not

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.319
properly mixed up because after they sit

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.879
they will separate I apply my hardener

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.560
from the center to the outside edge of

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.060
my puddle and in normal temperatures

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.920
that's going to be the right amount of

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.360
hardener for your filler if it's a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.220
hotter day you're going to want to use a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.720
little bit less hardener if it's cooler

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.120
day you might want to use a little bit

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.940
more when mixing you don't want to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.879
introduce any extra air into your filler

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.580
so avoid stirring it you want to fold it

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.700
in until it's all one uniform color and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.620
you have no streaks if you stir it or

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.080
introduce air you're going to cause

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.360
pinholes when you spread it on your

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.500
panel and start block sanding it and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.140
then you're going to have to correct

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.879
those after mixing if you press out the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.800
filler flat on your panel that's going

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.840
to help eliminate those air pockets as

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.160
well it's also going to dissipate the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.080
heat so you're going to have a little

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.300
bit more time to work with this filler

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.920
before it kicks get a small amount on

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.019
your spreader and press it into the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.519
metal this will promote adhesion you

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.379
don't need to put it on all at once

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.019
we're going to put several coats on

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.300
while this is wet and we'll add filler

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.040
with each additional coat I'll spread it

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.540
on the top section first down to that

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.400
body line and then we'll come back to

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.220
the bottom section and we'll start

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.440
forming that body line out of filler now

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.120
we can start adding some more filler we

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.400
can decrease the pressure on our

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.319
spreader and allow that filler to fill

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.300
all those low areas so then when we go

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.060
to block it out we'll have a nice

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.280
straight panel

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.780
okay so now we're going to do the first

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.340
sanding on this I'm going to put a

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.940
little guide coat on here just to show

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.480
you uh how it blocks out today I'm going

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.519
to be using this uh 3M cubatron extract

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.440
sandpaper supposed to be really good

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.319
sandpaper supposed to last a long time

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.299
and really cut well cost effective too

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.700
because even though it's a little bit

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.340
more expensive it's going to last a heck

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.860
of a lot longer I like the shape with 80

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.239
grit you could shape with 36 grit it's a

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.099
coarser paper it's going to cut it

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.100
quicker but it leaves very deep

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:22.139
scratches that you have to remove so my

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.360
progression is 80 grit 180 32 600. here

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.520
I'm using a flexible long block because

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.800
this quarter panel has these Contours

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.259
and we want this block to lay flat

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.360
against that panel in order to get it

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.580
straight it's best to use the longest

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.560
block possible that you can lay flat

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.300
against the surface now if you don't

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.220
have a long block you could use a small

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.919
block but you just have to work your way

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.199
across the panel doing sections at a

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.360
time but it's always best to use a long

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.160
block if possible and I have links to

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.300
all the tools and products I use down in

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.460
the description

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.520
the technique to block is a cross

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.320
Hatcher x pattern you want to go in all

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.840
different directions so the important

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.759
thing is you don't want to just block in

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.460
One Direction Block in different

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.800
directions you want to level this filler

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.600
out that is the whole goal in order to

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.220
get this panel straight I'll block the

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.440
lower section of this quarter panel

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.479
first blocking up to that body line and

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.220
then we'll work the top section and

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.680
we'll block down to it

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.120
as I'm blocking this I can see we have a

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.039
little bit of a low area where that

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.900
guide code is at the front of this

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.820
quarter panel will have to address that

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.400
and I'm starting to break through into

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.979
some bare metal so what I want to do now

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.560
is to stop on this lower section and

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.060
we'll start working the top section once

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.280
you hit bare metal you're no longer

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.840
blocking that filler straight you need

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.120
to address that metal you either need to

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.580
tap it down and add some more filler in

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.160
that area or add filler over the entire

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.560
repair area and block that once again

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.020
these hires were very minor so I was

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.240
able to tap those down with the flat

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.860
round section of my body Hammer you

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.720
could also use a paint stick or a

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.759
shrinking slapper with your body Hammer

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.139
to knock down those eye areas now I went

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.360
ahead and cleaned this panel with some

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.340
isopropyl alcohol and then I masked off

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.620
that body line and we're going to lay

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.280
another coat of body filler over this

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.280
lower section

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.320
once we applied the filler we'll go

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.419
ahead and pull the tape and then we'll

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.759
block over this with 80 grit sandpaper

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.860
we want to smooth this out with the 80

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:27.440
grit and then I'll go over it with 180

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.440
grit to refine those 80 grit scratches

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.240
I'll apply some guide coat and then

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.160
we'll work from the front to the rear of

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.840
this quarter panel straightening it out

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.180
as we go and if you're using a small

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.680
block you can this is the technique you

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.720
want to use you want to do it in

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.699
sections make sure you're going blocking

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.560
in all different directions to get that

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.360
nice and flat now off camera I went

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.900
ahead and blocked this entire repair

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.699
area with 180 grit sandpaper now we're

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.400
ready to clean this so I'm going to wash

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.620
this with some isopropyl alcohol we just

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.180
have a few minor imperfections and a few

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.139
little waves but we're going to correct

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:06.120
all that with some glazing putty I'll go

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.919
ahead and re-tape this body line quickly

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.620
and then we'll lay our glazing putty

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.539
right up to that line pull the tape and

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.860
that'll help give us a guide to shape

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:15.600
that body line

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.360
this is the product I'll be using today

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.340
this is USC icing this is a glazing

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.400
polyester glazing putty is what it is

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.979
it'll fill any imperfections it'll also

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.900
feel scratches so we have some 80 grit

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.520
scratches that we might have missed this

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.340
is a good insurance pot to get those

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.780
filled and not primer over those we have

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.780
a few little waves that we're going to

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.699
block out using this glazing putty we

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.620
won't need a whole lot to do this entire

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:43.440
quarter panel this is going to be a very

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.960
thin coat to fill some minor scratches

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.940
in a few little waves so we poured a

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.220
little bit on our pallet We'll add our

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.500
hardener we'll fold it until it's all

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.660
one uniform color and then we'll apply

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.280
it to the panel when you're applying

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.440
this glazing putty you want to press it

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.060
in firm you want it to be as smooth as

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.099
possible because remember we're almost

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.259
done with this repair and the less

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:06.660
blocking we have to do at this point the

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:09.960
better this is a very thin coat and it

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.940
blocks very easy so 180 grit sandpaper

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.979
is what you sand this with then we'll

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.599
block over it with 320 to get it

00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:17.599
prepared for primer

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.060
I'll go ahead and pull the tape and then

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.340
we'll apply our icing to the bottom half

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.560
of this repair I hope you're finding

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.660
this video helpful if you are or if you

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.099
have any questions let me know down in

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.260
the comments below

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:35.880
so the icy came out nice and smooth we

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.500
have a little Ridge right on the byline

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.240
that's okay we're going to block up to

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.800
that and block down to it and we'll

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.760
shape that right at the end just before

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.760
we primer it

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.060
I'll add a little guide coat to make

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.160
sure we're getting this sanded smooth

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.320
and we'll get our 80 grit sandpaper

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.720
along with our flexible block and block

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.560
this in an x pattern until we got it

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.560
perfectly smooth

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.279
after the icing starts to smooth out I

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.920
switch over to 320 or a sandpaper and

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:07.200
finish my blocking with 320 to remove

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.279
those 180 grit scratches and get it

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:14.339
ready for primer now I am using the 3M

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:16.860
cubaton 2 extract sandpaper and I love

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:19.080
that sandpaper it works great Cuts

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:22.080
beautifully so now I'm just fitting up

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.480
the rear bumper I noticed that the body

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.640
line is not quite where I want it to be

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.440
so I need to make some adjustments there

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.740
I'm going to do a little bit of blocking

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.080
and shaping of that body line and blend

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.360
it in basically to the rest of the

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.980
quarter panel now we are painting this

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.680
rear bumper so we're not worried about

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:44.480
320 grit scratches on that bumper this

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.480
is going to be sanded down and painted

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.360
now we've got this body line matching up

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.100
perfectly so it's time to Prime

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.820
the primer we're using today is the

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:59.519
U-Pull system 20 2253 it is a high Build

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.860
primer that mixes up four to one to one

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:03.540
for the primer surfacer which is what

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.339
we're going to be using today we don't

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.080
want a really thick High Build primer

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:09.360
because this panel is perfectly straight

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.580
so we'll find our mixing ratio on the

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.800
bottom of our disposable cup system this

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.440
is the savito Disposable cup system it's

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.380
a budget friendly disposable cup

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.660
and we'll mix it up to that ratio we'll

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:26.040
add our four parts primer

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:28.920
our one part activator the 23 23

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.620
and one part of urethane reducer

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.120
we'll mix it up we'll add our lid now

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.740
you want to make sure this is sealed I

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.240
always like to lift it up make sure it's

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.580
nice and sealed it's not going to leak

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.260
we'll add our collar and we're ready to

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.880
spray our primer so I went ahead and

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.380
masked this off

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:47.040
the gun I'll be using today is the

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:49.140
Eastwood lt100 this is a low CFM gun

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.260
sprays really well does a really good

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.820
job with paint sealer clear coat we're

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.880
going to go ahead and set our air

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:59.459
pressure at about 15 psi we'll have our

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:03.180
fan pattern wide open and we'll have our

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:05.160
volume turn three turns out from closed

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.260
I'll apply one coat we'll let it flash

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:11.540
off for 15 minutes and then we'll apply

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.540
a second coat of this 2K urethane primer

00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:28.380
now we're ready for the second coat and

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.880
I'm going to use this little gun bud

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.880
this is a light for your spray gun

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.720
oh yeah this is key if you're working in

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.399
a home garage you have poor lighting get

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.040
yourself one of these gun buds or

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:42.899
something similar this works great in

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.760
this environment you're not in a paint

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:47.820
booth you don't have a ton of lighting

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.560
but if you add one of these now you can

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.600
see what you're doing especially if

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.360
you're doing Blends when I'm in a dark

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.740
area and I'm trying to primer

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.740
he's coming really handy

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.500
listen if you want to learn how to prep

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.839
out and prepare your primer for paint

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.519
