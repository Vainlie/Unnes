00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:10.349
where is the meat of the pattern how do

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:11.969
we know that what's going on everyone

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.340
and welcome back to another episode of

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.960
paint society the channel where the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.460
learning doesn't stop when the video

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.529
ends today

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.250
we have a great one for you a really

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.180
important basic how to set up your gun

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.340
to paint a car or any automotive part so

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.560
let's go ahead let's jump right into the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.989
booth I got a little chart setup for you

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.329
or going to learn some stuff today okay

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.739
class for today what we're gonna be

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.219
doing is we're going to be utilizing

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.410
this chart we're gonna learn about fan

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.320
fluid in air the three basic most

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.469
adjustments we will need in order to get

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.469
a good spray pattern once we learn it

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.930
we're going to apply it right away onto

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.510
our bumper that is the easiest and the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.789
best way I feel it is for you guys to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.829
learn so we can see exactly what we're

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.199
doing we're gonna show you how the paint

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.880
goes on we're gonna zoom in on the paint

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.070
and show you what's going on

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.049
alright so let's get started today what

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.390
we're going to be using is a sealer

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.610
first because that is what the bumper

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.030
will need so let's first get familiar

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.850
with our paint gun on our paint gun we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.100
have first our pressure air comes in

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.790
through the bottom it goes through the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.790
whole paint gun it atomizes the paint to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.850
be released through the nozzle and onto

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.860
your panel so air is very important but

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.990
we're not going to adjust air just yet

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.170
the first thing that we're gonna do is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.600
take a look at what do all these now

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.729
it's me I chose the GTI pro light

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.340
because it is a very traditional gun and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.189
it matches many other guns that are on

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.009
the market now and all basic guns are

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.350
very similar on the bottom we have the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.110
air adjustment valve I keep this

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.610
completely open all right so you can put

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.840
it all the way in and then turn it all

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.409
the way out that stays completely open

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.080
next up we have our fluid now that I

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.120
have my PPS with the sealer out I can

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.459
show you how we set it up and what a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.819
good base line is so first I'm gonna

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.910
squeeze my handle all the way in and I'm

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.920
gonna back out this and just until it

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.590
comes off all right if it comes off we

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.459
put it right back on now I'm gonna turn

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.950
this until I get resistance okay at this

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.769
point right here and it stopped moving

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.470
okay if I were to release just trigger

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.519
it would keep moving so let's back it

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.100
out once more pull the trigger and we

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.220
turn it it is stopped moving this

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.280
setting right here is called wide open

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.190
the fluid is now at a wide open setting

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.739
and we can adjust from wide open so we

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.440
can do one turn from wide open

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.140
two turns from wide open I like to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.720
adjust one turn at a time so let's kick

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.760
this back out so wide open once more

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:12.420
trigger crust turning to the right which

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.820
is clockwise until it stops now this is

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.459
our fan control right on top it is

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.440
different from our fluid and it controls

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:25.079
how wide the pattern is okay so some

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.730
fans can be super wide some fans can be

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.709
a little bit small and I'll show you

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.049
what fan means on the board in just a

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.540
moment for here we keep it all the way

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.940
out and we can just give it a little bit

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.050
of a quarter of a turn just to clean up

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.360
our edges now let's apply what we've

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.720
learn through the charm we just

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.650
discussed fan fluid and air once again

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.320
we have our air we have our fluid and we

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.480
have our fan you keep this wide open and

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.670
we adjust from here free now we're gonna

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.800
put our air right around 22 now just

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.900
because it's at 29 now does not

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.610
necessarily mean it's gonna spray at 29

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.120
you want to just your air when you have

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.380
your trigger cooled at least half way

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.800
speaking of which when you pull it

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.800
halfway only air comes out if you pull

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.830
it more you have your fluid coming out

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.049
so this right here is the pattern we're

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.910
gonna discuss now this is how we want

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.210
our pattern to look it should never be

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.690
top-heavy or bottom heavy we want to be

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.820
about this much away from the panel so

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.680
to do that you're gonna take your pinky

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.340
and your thumb and you're gonna put your

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.370
middle fingers down and that is the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.520
distance just about that you want to be

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.610
from your panel okay from that distance

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:51.680
we are gonna recreate this spray pattern

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:55.310
right here at about 23 psi as we can see

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.670
now they are very similar if it was

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.400
white on top or white on the bottom and

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.620
thin in the middle that means that these

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.900
little holes right here are not cleaned

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.720
out and they're not allowing the air to

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.100
spray properly to demonstrate that I'm

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.770
gonna plug up one of these little holes

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.480
with tape so right now we put a little

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.400
piece of tape right there and we're

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.590
gonna try to represent what it would be

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.870
like if you had not cleaned up your gun

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.800
and watch my video on how to properly

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.800
clean a gun

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.380
take a look at the pattern out you see

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.350
on the bottom how it's much wider than

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.180
the top at the bottom you can see it's

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.640
kind of thick and what that would mean

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.830
is you could possibly have too much

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.290
fluid going towards the bottom and that

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.150
type of thing could give you a run on

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.440
one of your panels huh

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.330
let's remove it and let's try again now

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.630
with it removed let's take a look at

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.540
we'll see what our pattern looks like we

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.300
have one correct pattern one correct

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:02.530
pattern and one pattern that kind of

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.930
goes off to the side and is fat on the

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.270
bottom over here we have a nice pattern

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.670
like I said because it's nice and even

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.920
so that could come just from having a

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.880
paint gun that is not clean

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.860
now let's discuss when we can use our

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.560
fan and dial it in and what some of the

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.970
capabilities of the actual gun are what

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.490
we're going to be doing now is turning

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.650
our fan all the way in now when you're

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.440
turning your fan in your pressure

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.720
actually raises well it doesn't actually

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.840
raised on a gauge but you're sending so

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.930
much more feet to a small area rather

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.900
than spreading it out on a fan remember

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.820
a wide fan is like this when you dial it

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.910
all the way in you're taking all that

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.160
paint and bringing it down into one

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.460
little circle so you can run it really

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.740
easy let me show you what a all-the-way

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:58.470
turn in fan looks like now we're gonna

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.470
represent that dot right next to it

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.370
just like that so just by turning that

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.930
in that's what happens now let's turn it

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:10.200
out about one turn from the fan getting

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:15.670
a little bit bigger

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:19.350
another turn a little bit bigger let's

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:22.630
turn it out just a little bit more a

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:26.770
little bit bigger so this is pretty much

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:31.390
your fan okay then we dial it all the

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:35.860
way in and we turn down our pressure and

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:39.010
we turn in our fluid we can almost get

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:43.200
really creative with it because if it

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.200
can become so very fine

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.870
did you guys see that I barely triggered

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:11.439
it okay you don't have to pull it all

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:13.000
the way you can barely pull it and it

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:16.090
kind of is like a little bit of an

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.180
airbrush so if you got an area that you

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.860
need to kind of just blow in air at the

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.349
corner of the door where he maybe you

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:27.550
burn through you can kind of open up

00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:29.919
your fan a little bit you can turn in

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:34.510
your fluid and you can lower your

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:36.729
pressure just it on now all about it's

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.829
fun right but this it really good is it

00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:41.260
really gonna help you to write your name

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:43.810
on a car yeah it might be pretty cool

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.420
but we need to know where we should be

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:48.579
spraying when we have our gun optimized

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.649
for the perfect settings where is the

00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:52.510
meat of the pattern how do we know that

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:53.730
well let's go back to our initial

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.880
settings that I taught you before

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.070
remember

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.200
fan wide-open give it a little bit of

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.959
turn to kind of clean up that that those

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.790
edges take your fluid and I'm gonna do

00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:06.940
it upside down I'm gonna disconnect my

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:09.220
air I'm gonna do upside down so the

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.870
fluid doesn't come out the gun I'm gonna

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.930
turn it all the way out I'm gonna hold

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:16.209
that trigger once more I'm going to push

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:18.550
it in turn it in until it stops I'm wide

00:09:16.209 --> 00:09:19.899
open I'm right where I want to be you're

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.870
gonna play around with the air pressure

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:25.390
with the fan remember you need enough

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:28.600
air to fill that fan let's talk about a

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:30.019
WS 400 for instance that gun has a huge

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.089
fan if

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:34.220
have enough air it won't fill up the fan

00:09:32.089 --> 00:09:37.249
and you'll have just a lot of dry spray

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.350
going into the air now that we have our

00:09:37.249 --> 00:09:42.230
gun all set up let's make believe that

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:45.139
our panel is just about here where we

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.079
want our meat of the pit of the actual

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:49.579
fan to be where it's the best

00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:52.160
optimization the best itemization is

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:55.549
right in that area which is why we use

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.549
this distance so if we're spraying we

00:09:55.549 --> 00:10:01.730
should be right around here and we want

00:09:58.549 --> 00:10:03.860
this area right here where you're

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.259
spraying this far away we're only

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:09.739
getting a dust but if our panel is right

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:12.049
here we are getting what matters most

00:10:09.739 --> 00:10:16.329
and what matters most is that thick

00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:19.839
block of atomization watch it right here

00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:19.839
too far away

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:28.820
look we got inconsistent spray pattern

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.820
now let's go just at the right distance

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.280
do you see the difference in the spray

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:39.660
pattern do you see how beautiful is now

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.660
let's apply it right here

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.589
okay so we just applied what we learned

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:54.500
here with air pressure fluid in your fan

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:56.930
and we apply it to our bumper so we took

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.970
our chart and now we're applying it to

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.260
see work in real life

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:04.950
let's take a look

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.870
so what we have here is we just sprayed

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:11.250
our sealer now this will drive flat and

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:13.500
then we have the edge of our fan now we

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.300
like to have a very nice soft edge and

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.780
look at the droplet size do you see how

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:20.880
fine they are okay let's make believe

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.680
that we've had a lower pressure remember

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.140
that video on how does break their coat

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.660
and I discussed atomization and how big

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.220
droplets do not like each other and they

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.260
just kind of sit out there and we want

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.350
fine chocolates well that is exactly

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:37.160
what we have here so what I'll do now is

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:39.990
I'll continue that about 80% overlap

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:43.500
over the whole bumper take a look at

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:45.900
those fine droplets nice and smooth just

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.820
what we want remember this is a sealer

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.140
so what I'll do is I'll continue to

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.940
finish this I'll show you what it looks

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.590
like when it's all done alright so I

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.990
really hope that this gun setup video

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:58.320
helped you as you can see our bumper

00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:02.720
here is nicely painted it is completely

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:06.960
flat because we had a nice consistent

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:10.380
fan and fluid control paired with our

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.880
air pressure thanks to the charm if you

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.170
guys have any further questions make

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.330
sure you drop a line down in the

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.190
comments give me some time I always get

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.320
back to my comments and this is Brian

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:22.050
from King decided to remind of you don't

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.620
overthink it it's just paint I'll see

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:44.690
you guys in the next one

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:44.690
