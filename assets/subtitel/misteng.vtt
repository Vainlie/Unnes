00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
a very common problem when spraying

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.630
metallics is modeling our metallic

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.849
flakes that look uneven so today I'd

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.500
like to do a short video on a solution

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.350
to that problem that has always worked

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.529
for me and that is a miss coat drop coat

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.960
or a control coat the same method can be

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.480
used with base coat clear coat or single

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.640
stage but single stage you have to time

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.660
it just right too early and it just

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.579
melts in too late and you get dry spray

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.430
I've seen others decrease the air

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.370
pressure but I think increasing it a bit

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.430
works better so you can open the fan of

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.559
it stand back and really give it a Miss

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.199
coat so let's give it a try after

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.840
allowing your very last coat to tack up

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.809
just a bit and you can test it by

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.989
touching the the tape near some heavy

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.409
spray and making sure that it's sticky

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:10.680
what you're gonna do is back off turn up

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:13.500
the pressure up it and you're just gonna

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.509
basically crop-dust this thing so you're

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.630
gonna stand back a little bit higher

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.189
pressure and just give it a nice mist

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.189
coat or a dust coat

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.070
and that's it now we're just going to

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.170
let this dry come back give it a couple

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.170
coats of clear and we'll be finished

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.709
after a couple of coats of clear this is

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.190
a finished panel in review in order to

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.950
cure modeling or tiger stripes or

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.819
anything like that the uneven

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.910
distribution of metallic flakes on your

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.720
very last coat you're gonna spray it as

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:41.099
you normally would give it a few minutes

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.709
three four five minutes to tack up get

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.530
sticky then increase your pressure on

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.470
your spray gun back off a little bit and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.709
give it a nice mist coat to evenly

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.959
distribute those metallic flakes and get

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.590
them to stand up a little bit and look

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.230
nice and even across the whole panel

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.690
then give it about a half hour to dry or

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.870
even more and give it a couple coats of

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.049
clear so I hope you enjoyed this video

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.019
on how to cure modeling or tiger stripes

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:16.110
or metallic flakes that aren't behaving

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.750
themselves and if you did and you'd like
