00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.600
howdy howdy Chris here and welcome back

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.160
to garage noise today we're talking

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.160
about base coat clear coat finishes I'm

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.800
going to show you how to apply your base

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.320
coat so it's nice and silky smooth we're

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.679
also going to talk about clear coat

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.720
application and give you some secrets on

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.160
how to adjust your gun and some

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.720
different spraying techniques going to

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.199
help you apply a better looking clear

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.880
coat so let's get in the garage and make

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.760
some noise this is a 2018 Chevy Colorado

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.519
we painted this door previously the

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.120
color was a little bit off so we went

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.239
ahead and had O'Reilly come down with

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.520
their scan tool and they scanned it got

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.320
the color very close so it's a very

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.680
blendable color now we're going to

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.760
repaint this door we're going to blend

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.640
into this door here we're going to spray

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.719
the fender and then we're going to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.039
respray the bumper with the correct

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.640
color a color that's much closer than

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.600
the previous color we painted that

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.840
bumper so I'm going to share with you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.519
how to apply the base coat today had

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.000
some questions on how to apply base coat

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.160
people are getting rough finishes and I

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.839
want to share with you how to properly

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.720
apply that so you get a nice silky

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.400
smooth finish because if you don't get a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.759
silky smooth finish on your base coat

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.720
your clear coat will never be flat and

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.119
glassy so let's talk about how to set up

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.280
your gun for base coat and how to apply

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.040
it for a silky smooth finish this is the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.640
gun we're going to be using for the base

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.640
coat now for the clear coat I'm going to

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.360
go ahead and use the cigola 3300 GTO I'm

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.880
excited to show you that gun and share

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.439
with you how well that gun performs but

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.040
as far as our gun set settings for our

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.759
base coat we're going to want to go

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.759
ahead and turn this fluid knob in all

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.240
the way and then we're going to do two

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.280
turns out from closed

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.360
one two we're going to adjust our air

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.240
pressure to for base coat you want to

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.799
run it between 15 and 20 psi maybe a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.600
little bit higher than 20 psi you're

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.880
just going to have to judge for yourself

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.759
but on this particular gun around 20 psi

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.439
is perfect now as far as the fan pattern

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.079
I'm going to open up the fan pattern all

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.799
the way and then I'm just going to to

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.039
dial it back core of return now this gun

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.560
is a low volume low pressure paint gun

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.319
so it requires less cfms to operate so

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.239
it consumes less air to operate

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.040
efficiently uh so it's a really good gun

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.400
for base coat go ahead and lay down some

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.640
base on this and I'll show you some

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.120
techniques to laying a smooth base so

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.720
I've already started laying some coats

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.519
of base on this this was a e-coat that

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.200
we sanded down with 600 and then we went

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.560
ahead and put some adhesion Promoter on

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.599
the edges and now we're going to lay it

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.560
lay down some more base now when you're

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.519
applying your first and second coat of

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.640
Base you want a medium to wet coat don't

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.879
want to put it on super wet right off

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.560
the bat if you're new to painting it

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.800
doesn't hurt at all to put a dust coat

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.280
on first there's a couple reasons why

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.959
this might be helpful if you're spraying

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.000
in an open garage you're not spraying in

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.840
a booth you're not spraying in a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.200
controlled environment a light coat over

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.000
the panel introduces that paint to the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.760
surface if there's going to be any any

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.760
kind of chemical reaction it's going to

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.640
reduce that I sprayed a vehicle the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.000
other day that was just purchased and it

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.920
was covered with Tire dressing so

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.360
silicone which is the absolute worst

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.519
thing you can put on a vehicle if you're

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.080
going to be painting it this thing was

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.280
had a bath of silicone so I had to wipe

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.519
it down like six different times and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.560
still when I applied my base I put a

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.920
medium to wet coat on and there's a

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.879
couple little uh fishe eyes which is a

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.560
paint Separation on the panel now that's

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.959
easily taken care care of you can just

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.319
let it dry and then Dust coat it and

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.799
most of the time it's not going to

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.840
affect your finish at all or you could

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.879
just scuff it down a little bit and then

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.560
recat it in base but my point is put a

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.319
dust coat on first just for insurance

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.159
just a light coat especially if you're

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.159
new to painting or you're in an

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.159
uncontrolled environment put your light

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.720
coat on first then you want medium to

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.760
wet coats typically it's two to three

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.319
coats until you get coverage if you feel

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.439
like you're not getting enough material

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.840
on the panel then just move a little

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.280
closer to the panel you don't have to

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.360
adjust your gun or you can just bump up

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.159
your fluid volume just a little bit if

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.680
you want that silky smooth finish it's

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:13.519
important that you overlap your passes

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.440
about 80% especially with a low volume

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.160
low pressure paint gun now 80% means you

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.519
make a pass and then on your second pass

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.560
you're going to cover 80% of that

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.600
previous pass so you're overlapping your

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.800
previous pass by

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.320
80% first thing I'm going to do is cut

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.320
in under here

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.039
now we'll make our we'll make our first

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.039
pass over

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.320
here now I'm overlapping

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.199
okay so we'll let this flash off for

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.000
about 15 minutes you want to let your

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.560
base coats flash off for about 15

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.759
minutes in between coats on a hot day it

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.160
may be more like 10 but we'll let this

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:01.960
set up just for a little bit we'll come

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.440
back take a look at it see how it looks

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.880
see if we need to make any adjustments

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.440
on our gun okay so let's take a look at

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.880
this it's been about 10 minutes it's

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.160
pretty warm today 80Â° this is dry and

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.080
you can see how it's kind of flashed off

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.759
it's pretty smooth I mean we could bump

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.800
up our air pressure just a little bit uh

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:23.120
I think this gun runs pretty good around

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.440
20 to 24 PSI to be honest with you so

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.880
what we'll do is we'll put one more coat

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.880
of base on this it's pretty much covered

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.479
now and then we'll look over it with a

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.599
sunlight now as far as the blend on this

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:36.160
door what I'm going to do is we're

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:39.080
really blending the color into this door

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.599
I'll turn my tip so it's spraying like

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.599
this and I'll run one pass down this so

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:46.960
we start the blend and then I'll cover

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:48.840
this door with color one coat of color

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.759
and then our blend will be started on

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.960
this door and then I'll show you how we

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:55.520
blend out into the door okay as far as

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.360
the bumper cover is concerned we just

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.599
need to get a couple coats of paint on

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.960
this I've got a couple burn areas we

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.560
need to cover up here right here's one

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.599
um basically we just need to get the

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.479
right color on this when I spray this

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.639
door I'm going to start with this right

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.120
here and I'm going to put a coat or two

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.879
right here covering this edge of this

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.720
door now when I cover the rest of this

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.960
door I don't have to come out to the end

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.080
I don't want a bunch of overspray

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:24.640
blowing out into this door so I can just

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:27.870
come to right here and we'll be good

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.870
[Music]

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.339
[Music]

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:14.019
[Music]

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.740
[Music]

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.640
Okay so we've got one coat on the door

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.880
I've got one coat on the blend we'll put

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.800
another coat on here another coat on the

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.440
door and then we'll start blending out

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.640
into this door here Fender is covered

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.120
I'm going to show you how you can do a

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.000
drop coat probably just show you how to

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.120
do the drop coat on the door we need one

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.399
more coat on this bumper cover so let's

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.680
go ahead and spray another coat on this

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:12.200
and then I'll show you how to do a drop

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.200
coat if you're doing a high metallic

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.200
finish

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.399
as I put my final coat on I'm going to

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.880
come out to about here about 6 in out

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:44.760
and then after I put that coat on I'm

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.519
going to do a drop coat right here so

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.920
what I'll do when I do a drop coat is

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:52.959
I'm going to do a cross pattern like it

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.600
kind of this way and then kind of this

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:58.040
way and what I'm do instead of five to

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.279
six inches away I don't adjust my gun

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.200
all I do is move back about 2 to 3 in

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:05.920
and then do a drop coat that's all you

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.240
need to do and that works really well on

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.720
metallics as well but you only want to

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.880
do it once you don't need to do multiple

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.880
coats of that because then you'll get

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:19.399
dry spray and you'll get a roughness in

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.399
your base and you don't want that

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.760
another thing is when I'm ending I don't

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.480
want a hard line here so when I'm ending

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.760
after the four to six after the six

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.079
inches I kind of just turn my wrist out

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.639
a little bit and then I start coming

00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:20.639
back the other direction

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:39.800
now drop coat right

00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:42.040
here see I'm moving back from it a

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.040
little

00:11:53.480 --> 00:12:00.320
ways and that's it now we got a Perfect

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.720
Blend we're going to pour this to four

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.440
4:1 mixing ratio and now we're going to

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.880
add our one part of activator and this

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:13.000
is the gun we're using today this is the

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:15.399
cigola 3300 GTO using the cigola 3300

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.079
GTO this is a beautiful gun lays down a

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:22.320
beautiful finish it does consume about

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:26.920
10.4 cfms of air so compared to the

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:29.760
aeropro a610 or the R500 this is a

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.199
AirHog but it does produce a beautiful

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.240
looking clear coat so as far as the gun

00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:36.680
set up for clear coat there's four

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.800
things I really want you to understand

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.399
the full four most important things when

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.279
you're laying down clear coat is your

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:45.680
air pressure your fluid volume your

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:48.079
speed and your distance the speed and

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.160
your distance affect how that clear coat

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:52.680
lays down and you can do a lot of

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.920
different adjustments just by changing

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.240
your speed and your distance from the

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.720
panel we're going to set up this gun at

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.760
three turns out from close

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.920
so we're closing it all the way we're

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.399
turning it three turns out okay fan

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.839
pattern is going to be wide open I'm

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:12.040
setting the air pressure at 26 PSI you

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:14.000
want to start with a base setting that

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.800
you're comfortable with now I do

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.880
recommend that you're under three turns

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.560
out from closed on your fluid volume

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.240
when you adjust that to under three

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.399
turns out on your fluid volume you can

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.000
make some adjustments with your speed in

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:28.279
your distance and I want you to try that

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.120
and understand how that affects your

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:32.320
clear coat so let's go ahead and spray

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.600
this Fender we'll see how it turns out

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.279
I'm going to be four or 5 in away I'm

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.880
going to overlap my passes about

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:43.120
80% that's important because that gives

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.920
you a second coverage on that wet Edge

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.680
and it's going to allow that clear coat

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.680
to flow out better

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.040
see I'm different techniques here

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.870
[Music]

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.759
overall all this finished came out

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.440
beautifully now on these two doors I did

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:35.319
have some particles of dust that I had

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.000
to pick out so I did end up putting a

00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:38.800
third coat of clear on this I didn't

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.240
show you guys that so it has a little

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.440
bit more texture than I would like but

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:45.120
it's still just like the OEM finish one

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.959
day I'll do a whole video on how to

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.279
overcome obstacles when you're painting

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:49.800
if that's something you'd be interested

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:51.480
in let me know down in the comments

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.680
below thin wet coats is what you want

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.040
when you're laying down clear coat if

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.600
you add another layer of clear then

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.920
you're going to have some more texture

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.480
now as far as the

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.279
fender we got a little piece of lint

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.959
there that'll have to buff out I

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:06.400
actually bumped up the air pressure a

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:08.199
little bit to about 28 PSI and it flowed

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.559
out a little bit better although this is

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:12.600
a flat surface and when you're spraying

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:15.160
a flat surface it always flows out just

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.679
a little bit better so this is really

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.559
flat few little particles of

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:23.280
dust but we'll cut and buff those out as

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:25.720
far as the bumper came out nice but I

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.360
hope you guys are understanding what I'm

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.840
trying to say here as far as your speed

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.559
and your distance and it's making sense

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.360
to you if it's not and you have

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:36.240
questions uh leave them down in the

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.280
comments below I'm happy to answer any

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.600
questions you have this will help with

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.919
your application of your clear coat I

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.640
just want you guys to experiment with it

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:48.880
try different things and see what works

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.640
best for you let me know about your

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.960
project and if you found this video
