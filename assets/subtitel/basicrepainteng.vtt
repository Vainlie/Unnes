00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.800
foreign

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.059
[Music]

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.040
what you see in front of you is our

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.080
freshly painted Datsun project and

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.820
clearly the results are excellent

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.619
we want to show you how to paint your

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.310
car at home and get the same great

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.400
results

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.380
[Music]

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.060
so in diving into the Bodywork on a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.220
project you may not know what's hiding

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.840
beneath the paint in that case the best

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.120
move might be to strip it to Bare Metal

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.920
start with a clean slate and that's what

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.380
we did with the dots in here

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.480
using a combination of tools including a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.340
DA Sanders our SCT and chemical

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.140
stripping we'll get this car back to the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.940
Bare Bones so we can see what's in front

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.739
of us

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.059
sure enough we did find some old body

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.680
filler hiding

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.239
we finished conditioning the metal by

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.520
going over the entire car with the SCT

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.379
if you don't have that you can use a DA

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.640
with 80 grit paper

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.680
now that the car is still stripped of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.360
all old issues we need to prevent some

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.399
rusting and give us a base to start

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.559
working from so we apply a couple coats

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.700
of our Eastwood epoxy primer over the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.680
entire car

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.900
note that the body filler we'll be using

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.119
can be applied over bare metal or over

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.799
the primer we're opting for primer as it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.840
better fits our timeline and gives us a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.460
visual indicator of highs and lows you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.439
can do either method just make sure to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.180
follow the product guidelines now that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.159
our car isn't going to rust away on us

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.000
we can move on to the next step body

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.840
filler

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.280
[Music]

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.320
once the epoxy primer has hardened for

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.119
at least two to three days we give the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.040
panel entire wipe down with pre-painting

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.200
prep to remove any dust and contaminants

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.360
on this project we're also showcasing

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.340
our new dustless Sandy block or dsb

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.119
which is why we have the shop split in

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.280
half

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.420
we have more videos on the dsb and you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
can check them out on our YouTube

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.680
channel but let's just say this thing

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.420
works whatever your preferred block is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.700
you can start blocking the whole car

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.860
with 80 grit sandpaper make sure to work

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.600
on a cross hatch x-patter and move

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.579
across the panel so it comes out nice

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.140
and flat you'll probably have an idea of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.780
problem areas going into this step

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.240
anywhere you did metal work old repairs

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.539
dents Etc but this will quickly reveal

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.400
the highs and lows across each panel

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.319
the dark spots are the areas where your

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.420
block can't get into that's why they're

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.280
there it's unsanded primer these are the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.260
areas that we'll work on later using the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.540
filler on this project I made a door

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.520
skin shave some holes and replace lower

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.959
quarter panels and other rust areas so I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.640
knew these areas would need some

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.560
attention once you have the whole car

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.620
blocked with 80 give it another wipe

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.300
down with pre and start adding filler

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.160
now there are two general approaches to

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.920
filler you can either spot repair and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.200
just add filler to your low spots or you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.819
can skim coat the entire panel sanding

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.860
most of it off but knowing that your

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.959
panel is going to be flat we did a bit

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.120
of both on the doors fenders and roof we

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.800
opted to skim coat everything as there

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.879
were a lot of imperfections across these

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.099
panels

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.379
the hood was mostly straight so we went

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.000
with the spot method either way you can

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.140
get the same results it's just a matter

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.720
of preference

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.760
I mentioned the Contour DSP This Thing

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.620
Really Works it collects about 95

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.180
percent of the dust from your filler

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.280
which is going to eliminate this ruining

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.019
your shop and your life also we added a

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.280
nylon blocking plate to the bottom of

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.920
this thing which is going to cut the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.480
filler fast and super flat if you're

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.280
going to be doing body work I highly

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.440
recommend getting one of these after

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.180
this first big skim coat is sanded down

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.739
and we think we're ready for more filler

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.480
we once again clean everything by

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.760
blowing the car off wiping down with

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.500
pre-painting prep we still need to apply

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.420
filler to the rest of the panels but the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.099
highs and lows are not as obvious so we

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.140
sprayed the core with guide coat to

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.060
identify these spots as well as all over

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.019
our filler to check those areas we're

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.019
also straight and smooth

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.200
now with our highs and lows identified

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.599
we can continue sanding the car with 80

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.400
grit applying filler as necessary to the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.840
dark low spots and checking with guide

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.040
coat until we get the car pretty

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.900
straight

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.400
another layer of guide coat and we can

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.440
work on sanding out our 80 grit

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.519
scratches by working through our finer

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.140
sanding grits 180 220 and 320. you'll

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.000
know you can move on when you no longer

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.159
see scratches in the guide code from the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.040
previous Grit

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:13.379
foreign

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.120
if you find surface defects and pinholes

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.160
you can use our glazing putty to spot

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.320
treat those areas simply mix it up just

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.880
like normal filler and block along with

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.560
the rest of the body we're using our

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.240
glazing putty because it's softer and

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.740
flows and we can continue with the grit

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.479
paper that we're using so we don't have

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.040
to take a couple steps back and repeat

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.020
the process

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.540
this is the longest step in the process

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.220
so be patient and take your time we have

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.500
several eight hour days of Bodywork into

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.699
this car but in the end your time will

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.199
pay off

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.120
once you're happy with the filler you

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.610
can move on to the next step which is

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:50.300
applying primer

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:52.740
[Music]

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.880
our body work is looking good and we're

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.560
anxious because we're ready to start

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.820
moving towards paint just like anything

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.500
else there are a lot of preferred

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.060
methods and workflows when going from

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.040
metal work through primer and paint

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.960
production shops will often coat which

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.400
is urethane primer while show car might

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.020
get two or three rounds of high build

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.400
polyester

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.560
we're going to show you the method we

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.840
did on this car and if you follow these

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.919
you'll get great results too for our

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.500
first coat we're going to use our

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.240
optiflow epoxy primer we'll go with

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.860
epoxy to seal all the body work up and

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.259
because it has great adhesion to both

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.000
metal and filler the kit also makes it

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.860
super easy for anyone to do in their

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.600
driveway or shop without needing an air

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.460
compressor paint gun or worrying about

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.160
overspray the kit includes everything

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.380
you need to apply including trays mixing

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.360
cups and rollers we use the included 2K

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.280
aerospray cans to hit all the hard to

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.560
reach areas and then roll two coats of

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.080
epoxy working from the hood back panel

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.820
by panel next we let it get nice and

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.340
hard for a couple days before blocking

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.320
with 320 grit this stage is also pretty

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.720
rewarding because we get to evaluate how

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.340
the car is looking in one solid color

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.560
at this point you could go one of two

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.060
ways urethane primer if your body work

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.039
is pretty straight and ready for paint

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.780
which we also offer as part of the

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.280
optiflow system

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.660
or if you still have some Sandy

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.940
scratches you can spray with our

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.680
polyester primer polyester primer is

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.419
like sprayable body filler and is

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.400
designed to fill the small imperfections

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.900
it's great for beginners as it's an

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.240
extra chance to get your panel straight

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.039
before paint we opt for the polyester to

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.840
fill in some remaining sanding scratches

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.180
we had missed and to help sharpen up

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.220
those Body Lines one last time

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.800
we do three full coats at a polyester

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:29.220
and let it set up over the weekend our

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.860
gun settings are 30 to 35 PSI a 2.0

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.479
needle nozzle 12 inch fan pattern and

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.900
three wet coats with about 15 minute

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:38.060
flash time in between

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.060
[Music]

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.860
with all the primer we should need on

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.360
the car we can apply another layer of

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.840
guide coat do a final block sand

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.419
[Music]

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.220
ING with 320 grit and 400 will finish

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.199
with 600 grit

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.819
just like on body filler your goal here

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.800
is to not have any sanding scratches

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.940
from the rougher grits visible as you

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.220
move on

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.020
if you find yourself struggling to get

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.280
sanding scratches out but the panel is

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.380
straight you can always wipe everything

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.479
down apply another coater to a primer

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.000
and begin blocking again

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:14.100
accidents happen got some cut throughs

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.600
and also some fillers showing so we'll

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.340
mix up what's called a seal coat

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.380
basically it's taking our epoxy and

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.940
reducing an additional 20 percent what

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.500
this does is it covers your bare spots

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.660
it gives you one uniform color on the

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.979
car in preparation for base coat this is

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.259
actually nice because a lot of painters

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.880
prefer applying base over the sealer

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:31.740
rather than your polyester primers

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.380
sealants can be top coated in the same

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.180
day or sprayed hardened and scuffed

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.580
before your base with the primer

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.020
finished to 600 grit or sealed we can

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.460
move on to the next step where we'll lay

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.099
down some color

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.479
[Music]

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:47.400
as far as prepped and you're ready to

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:49.259
bust out the paint gun but before you go

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.240
spraying your now super straight car

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:52.380
it's worthwhile to do a test panel to

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.819
make sure you have everything dialed in

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.680
just right

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:57.840
you have a lot of options when choosing

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.940
paint for your ride from single stage to

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.919
multi-stage system the single stage

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.020
paint job is basically a base coat and

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:06.000
clear coat in one formula meaning you

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.520
don't have to apply a separate base and

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.199
clear it's all done in one step this is

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.780
a great beginner and budget friendly

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:15.120
option the most common option is what

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.039
we're going to do a base coat clear coat

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.259
system we're using our OEM select base

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:22.680
coat for this project as it offers over

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:25.199
75 000 OEM colors where we found the

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.639
perfect shade of gray for this Datsun if

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:28.500
you want to browse our library of OEM

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:29.460
select colors check out the link in our

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.680
description

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.419
we prep a spare body panel we had laying

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.260
around and fill our paint gun while

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.260
using a strainer

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:41.279
for our base coat we're using a 1.3

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.680
needle about 15 psi and we're making

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:45.600
sure we have 50 overlap between each

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.459
pass you'll start by spraying color on

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.740
your edges and then making even passes

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:51.540
back and forth across your panel

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.760
we're not laying clear so we want it to

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.580
be a medium wetness not glossy with

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.920
about 15 minute flash time between coats

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.140
we apply three coats and since this is a

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.000
metallic we'll opt to do a drop coat a

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.640
drop coat is your final pass to make

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.279
metallics layout nice and even to do one

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.019
lower the pressure a few PSI move about

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:13.320
double the distance away from the panel

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:15.000
and in a movement as you see here

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.500
if you're not spraying a metallic you

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.959
can skip this step and move on after

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.060
three coats of bass

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:22.740
moving on to our clear coat we're using

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.080
our premium show clear and medium

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.880
activator as it's about 72 degrees in

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.680
our inflatable Booth the clear needs to

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.140
be mixed with the activator at a ratio

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.120
four to one using the mixing cup you'll

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.100
find a four to one ratio column add

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.959
clear to the fill line next take your

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.140
activator and add to the corresponding

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:42.720
fill line then use a stir to mix we set

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:45.480
the gun up with the same 1.3 needle 28

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.640
PSI and a 10 inch fan powder

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.100
while not necessary we have to do a tack

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.480
coat on the first pass attack code is a

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.760
semi-dry coat that helps promote

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.680
adhesion and prevent runs then follow up

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.620
with two wet on wet coats with about 15

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.019
minute flash between

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.519
our test panel came out great so now we

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:03.959
can apply these techniques to the car

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:06.180
now here's where we Face another

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:08.279
decision how do you color and clear on

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.320
the jams of the car also known as cut it

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:12.300
you can either blow the car apart paint

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.459
the jams paddles and body individually

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.980
or you can paint the jam specifically

00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:19.440
reassemble and then paint the body

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.180
for cutting the goal is to paint all the

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.580
areas that aren't accessible once the

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.560
car is assembled so we pop off the doors

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.000
deck lid and open the hood so we can

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.040
reach these spots

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.660
now you can tape up the car to prevent

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.940
overspraying the interior and under hood

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.980
using a technique called back taping

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.080
this is where we tape on the back side

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.220
of pinch welds and seams so we don't

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.220
create hard tape lines

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.380
we wipe down with pre-painting prep we

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.000
follow that up with a tack rag which is

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.300
a sticky cloth that will pick up any

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.279
remaining dust dirt or lint

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.380
with the car clean we can start spraying

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:57.240
focusing on the jams and letting color

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.899
blow onto the body now we'll address

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.899
this later

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.779
the color applied We can spray the clear

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:11.640
on using the settings we tested earlier

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:13.620
the great thing about performing cut in

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.360
is it gives you another opportunity to

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.100
get used to your gun paints and moving

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.040
around the vehicle before spraying the

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.779
part that everyone's eyes will be on

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.000
with that finished we let our paint get

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:27.740
hard for two days Bolt the panels back

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.740
on and move on to painting the body

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.760
the Datsun is reassembled now we can

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:38.220
address the overspray all over the body

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.320
we'll grab a DA with an interface pad

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.120
and 600 grit and give the whole car a

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.399
buzz down

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.440
additionally we use gray scuff pads for

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:48.120
anywhere the da can't reach well and to

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.040
make sure our surface is smooth to

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:53.959
promote good adhesion we shouldn't have

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.959
any shiny surfaces once we're done here

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.600
next we're on the final prep for paint

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.640
we blow the car off and wipe down with

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.200
pre-painting prep now we can tape up

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.180
everything we don't want paint to get on

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.640
for us this means all the windows under

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.079
hood tail light gaps and our freshly

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.180
painted jams

00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:11.339
so we use a combination of back taping

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.460
which we discussed earlier and foam tape

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:15.240
to get this job done

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.040
[Music]

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.660
with the car loaded into Booth our

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.000
painter gives it a final wipe down with

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.040
pre-painting prep and an attack Rag and

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.720
start spraying some base coat using the

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.580
same settings we determined on our test

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:31.800
panel

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:34.260
[Music]

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.600
after three coats plus the drop coat

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.339
she's on to clear one note here is to

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.560
make sure you maintain a wet Edge while

00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:42.720
moving around the full car for example

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.940
move from the quarter to the door to the

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.860
fender don't jump around the car you

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:50.639
want to avoid spraying over clear that

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:53.160
has flashed as it won't lay out nice

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:55.200
after two good coats we're all finished

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.639
we don't have a heated Booth so we'll

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.620
let this sit for as long as we can

00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:00.240
before disturbing for us that was about

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.560
three hours in the booth then we're able

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.899
to move it out in the studio and let

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.880
that cure over the weekend and voila you

00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:07.620
now have a freshly painted car

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.180
depending on how your paint job comes

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.220
out you might be happy enough to stop

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.320
here we're pretty happy seeing this

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.880
thing looking shiny in the studio but we

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.800
did have a bit of dirt and to clear some

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.180
orange peel and a couple runs and if

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.399
it's your first time you most likely

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.200
have an issue or two as well but that's

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:23.760
not a problem at all we let this sit for

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.840
about a week and we move on to the final

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:33.150
step cutting and buffing

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:33.150
[Music]

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:37.680
all right so you have Bodywork primed

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.120
sanded and painted but maybe you have a

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.800
few issues that happen to everyone in

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.959
the booth

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.399
we'll start by addressing the runs and

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:46.680
then we'll talk about cutting dirt and

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:49.320
orange peel I tackled the Run by dry

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.480
sanding with 800 grit on a block you can

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.339
focus on the high spots and do a slight

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.560
bit of cross blocking as you get it

00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:58.200
close to Flat once it's about 90 percent

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.300
there switch over to wet sanding 1000

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.560
grit until it's completely flat using

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.560
the cross blocking technique

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:08.579
now our Run's gone but we have orange

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:11.220
peel dirt and 1000 grit scratches in our

00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:14.279
door all of these get addressed at once

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:16.620
take 1500 grit on a DA an interface pad

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:18.839
and wet sand the entire door including

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.579
over the now flat run making sure to

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:22.620
avoid your edges though

00:14:20.579 --> 00:14:24.779
periodically wipe down the door so you

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.180
can check your progress once the texture

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:29.459
is gone shown here we hit the edges and

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.620
Body Lines with our 1500 by hand and

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:33.420
then switch over to 2000 grit on the DA

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.120
for a few more passes to make sure our

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.220
1500 grit scratches are all sanded out

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.019
now our door is super flat and we just

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.880
need to bring that shine back to do that

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:43.560
we recommend using a three-step system

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.899
starting with an aggressive cutting

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.820
compound wool pad and finishing with

00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:49.860
foam pads and polishing compounds

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.420
applying your cutting compound to the

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.279
face of the wool pad and spread it

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.899
around the panel you're working on then

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:57.720
add a little speed to the buffer and

00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:59.040
coat the work area in an even layer

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.839
now this part will take a little

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.820
practice ramp up the buffer to full

00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:05.220
speed and move across the paddle with a

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.899
little bit of pressure

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:09.300
you want to keep the PAD as close to

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:11.399
Flat as you can I typically ride the

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.260
right hand side and move horizontally

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:15.180
along the panel this keeps the pad

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.760
spinning down and gives me the best

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.740
control after several passes in an area

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.720
you should start seeing that shine come

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.579
back in your panel once your panel has

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.680
to shine back and it's not coming up any

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:27.839
further wipe it down with a microfiber

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.120
and move on to the next foam pad and

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:32.040
step two compound the goal for step two

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.500
is to remove any Haze Left Behind from

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.180
Step One the process is the same just

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.579
with foam and you won't need to hit this

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:42.380
as long or as aggressively

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:42.380
finally repeat for step three

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.220
now our doors show car flat with no runs

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:49.220
dirt or orange peel

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:55.640
we spent about a day addressing the rest

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:57.540
of the car and Bam show car Datsun

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.279
[Music]

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.840
the results really speak for themselves

00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:09.300
here this thing looks amazing

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:10.920
[Music]

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.420
every step of the process has worked

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.399
towards getting the great results that

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.440
we're proud of and that you can do at

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:26.880
grease and buffers there's no reason why

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.500
you can't achieve this at home
